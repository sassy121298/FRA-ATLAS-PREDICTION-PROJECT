# FRA Atlas – Forest Risk Assessment & Decision Support System

## Overview

FRA Atlas is a machine learning and GIS-based project designed to assess forest-related risks using environmental and spatial data. The system combines predictive modeling, decision support, and interactive web-based GIS visualization to support data-driven forest management and risk mitigation.

## Project Workflow

1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature encoding and scaling
4. Machine learning and deep learning model training
5. Model evaluation and validation
6. Risk-based decision support generation

## Dataset

Due to size constraints, the full dataset is not included in this repository.
* The complete dataset is stored externally (e.g., Google Drive or public data source)

Dataset type:

* Environmental and spatial forest-related data

---

## Decision Support System (DSS)

The Decision Support System analyzes model predictions and generates actionable recommendations related to forest risk levels. This helps support informed decision-making for forest monitoring, planning, and risk mitigation.

---

## Web GIS Visualization

The project includes an interactive web-based GIS map developed using Folium. The map visualizes forest risk zones with markers and clustering, enabling intuitive spatial analysis of high-risk and low-risk areas.

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook (`fra_atlas.ipynb`) in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Ensure required Python libraries are installed
3. Update the dataset path as mentioned in the notebook
4. Run all cells sequentially
